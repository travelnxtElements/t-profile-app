# General Considerations for designing hotel search

- Appropriate ways of displaying destination - Showing the city and airport names, three letter acronym for airport, and including some distinction to show the differences between cities and airports. Also having some distinction between city and point of interest.

- What should be the level of interaction between the two calendar fields?

- Should the calendar display holidays?

- Once date has been selected in a calendar control, how should it be displayed in the field - just dd/mm/yy or mm/dd/yy or should the day be mentioned as well?

- Choice of control to use for selecting number of adults, children and infants - dropdowns vs steppers

- Having the number of passengers section displayed upfront vs in a collapsible area

- Automatically taking the user to the next field, once he is done completing a particular field

- Validations specific to the search form like maximum number of allowed adults, children and total passengers

- Having error prevention mechanisms for issues like check out date not being prior to check in date

- Exploring alternate form design approaches like natural language forms

- Since this widget is basically a form, all form design considerations are also relevant

- Having default values for number of adults, children, check in and check out dates

- Same day searches to be allowed or not? How many days out can the user search? e.g. searching for the next 3 days is not allowed.

- How is child defined? What ages? Should there be a distinction between child and adult in the search form? Should the ages of children be collected? (metasearches may not need to collect this information as it can be entered later)

- Should there be an option to select number of rooms?

- Should any advanced options be present like star rating, guest rating, price range?
